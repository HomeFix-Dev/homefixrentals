<p>Your most common questions, answered clearly and simply.</p>

<section class="faq-section">
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do I have to purchase a Service Plan?</h3>
<p>
          No. All service plans are optional. They’re simply flat-fee add-ons to help you save time,
          prevent surprise cleaning/fuel charges, or protect yourself from minor accidental damage.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What’s included in the Fuel + Cleaning Plan?</h3>
<p>
          For about <strong>$15 per rental</strong>, we refill gas on applicable tools and perform
          standard rinsing/cleanup. You can return your tool without worrying about fuel levels or
          washing mud, dust, or debris.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What does the Damage Protection Plan cover?</h3>
<p>
          The <strong>$12 Damage Protection Plan</strong> covers minor accidental wear like dull
          blades, small cracks, scuffs, or general cosmetic damage from normal use. It does not cover
          loss, theft, misuse, or intentional damage.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How does the Extended Rental Plan work?</h3>
<p>
          For about <strong>$15</strong>, you get more time — such as late return the same day or
          overnight flexibility — without paying a full extra day rate. Perfect for last-minute
          finishing touches.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What is the Weekend Saver Plan?</h3>
<p>
          The Weekend Saver Plan gives you a flat weekend rate at about 
          <strong>1.5× the daily price</strong>. Pick up Friday evening, return Monday morning, and
          avoid paying for multiple single-day rates.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How does the Return Anytime Plan work?</h3>
<p>
          For <strong>$8</strong>, you can return tools after-hours using our designated secure
          drop-off area. No need to rush back before closing time.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do you offer delivery?</h3>
<p>
          Yes! Local delivery and pickup start at <strong>$25 one-way</strong> or 
          <strong>$40 round-trip</strong> within roughly 10 miles of Bessemer City. Great for large
          or heavy tools.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do I need a deposit?</h3>
<p>
          Some rentals require a refundable security deposit depending on the tool. The amount is
          confirmed when you submit your booking request.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What happens if I return the tool late?</h3>
<p>
          Late returns may be charged at the daily rate unless the Extended Rental Plan was added.
          If something changes, just communicate with us — we’re reasonable.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What do I need to bring for pickup?</h3>
<p>
          Bring a valid ID, a form of payment, and any safety gear you prefer. We also give a quick
          demonstration on safe tool operation.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can I rent multiple tools at once?</h3>
<p>
          Yes! You can rent as many tools as you'd like. Most service plans apply per booking (not
          per tool), which saves you money when renting in bundles.

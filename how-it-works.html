<h2>Optional Service Plans &amp; Add-Ons</h2>
<p class="subtitle">
          Make your rental easier with simple, flat-fee add-ons. Pricing below is typical and may
          vary by tool or distance.
        </p>
<div class="grid-3">
<div class="card">
<h3>Fuel + Cleaning Plan – $15</h3>
<p>
              Return gas-powered tools without worrying about fuel or cleanup. For about
              <strong>$15 per rental</strong> (for most gas tools), we top off fuel and handle
              standard rinsing/cleaning after your project.
            </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Damage Protection – $12</h3>
<p>
              For around <strong>$12 per booking</strong>, this plan helps cover accidental minor
              damage from normal use, like worn blades or cosmetic scuffs. It does not cover loss,
              theft, or abuse.
            </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Extended Rental – $15</h3>
<p>
              Need more time? For about <strong>$15 per booking</strong>, the Extended Rental Plan
              gives you extra hours or overnight flexibility so you’re not racing the clock.
            </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Weekend Saver – ~1.5× Day Rate</h3>
<p>
              Great for Friday–Monday projects. Most tools can be rented on a Weekend Saver rate at
              about <strong>1.5× the daily price</strong> (for example, a $55/day tool is about
              $85 for the weekend).
            </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Return Anytime – $8</h3>
<p>
              For about <strong>$8 per booking</strong>, you can arrange flexible or after-hours
              return using a designated drop-off spot (where available), so you don’t have to rush
              back during regular hours.
            </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Local Delivery &amp; Pickup – from $25</h3>
<p>
              No truck? No problem. Local delivery and pickup start at
              <strong>$25 one way</strong> or <strong>$40 round-trip</strong> within roughly
              10 miles of Bessemer City, for eligible tools and scheduled time windows.

<!-- Full Terms & Conditions section -->
<section class="terms-section" id="rental-terms">
<h2>Rental Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
<p class="subtitle">
          By renting equipment from HomeFix Rentals, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
        </p>
<ul class="terms-list">
<li class="terms-item" id="security-deposit">
<h3>1. Security Deposit</h3>
<p>
              A refundable security deposit may be required at the time of rental. The amount depends on the tool and is due in addition to the rental charges.
            </p>
<p>
              The deposit may be used to cover unpaid rental fees, damages, missing parts, cleaning, or fuel charges. Any remaining balance will be refunded after the equipment is returned and inspected.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="late-fees">
<h3>2. Late Fees</h3>
<p>
              Equipment must be returned on or before the agreed return date and time. Late returns may be charged at the full daily rate for each additional day (or portion of a day) past the due time.
            </p>
<p>
              Repeated or excessive late returns may result in additional service fees or refusal of future rentals.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="damage-charges">
<h3>3. Damage Charges</h3>
<p>
              The renter is responsible for any damage that occurs to the equipment during the rental period, excluding normal wear and tear.
            </p>
<p>
              If equipment is returned broken, abused, or missing parts, the renter will be charged the cost of repair or replacement, up to the full replacement cost listed in the catalog.
            </p>
<p>
              Do not attempt repairs yourself unless authorized by HomeFix Rentals.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="cleaning-fee">
<h3>4. Cleaning Fee</h3>
<p>
              All tools must be returned reasonably clean. Excessive dirt, mud, concrete, paint, oil, or debris may result in a cleaning fee being deducted from the deposit or added to the final invoice.
            </p>
<p>
              Concrete and mud must be rinsed off mixers, compactors, and similar tools immediately after use to avoid permanent buildup.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="fuel-policy">
<h3>5. Fuel Policy</h3>
<p>
              Gas-powered equipment must be returned with the same fuel level as when rented. If it is returned with less fuel, a refueling charge will apply.
            </p>
<p>
              Only use the correct fuel type and mixture as indicated on the equipment or by staff. Using the wrong fuel may result in damage charges.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="same-condition">
<h3>6. Returned in Same Condition</h3>
<p>
              All equipment must be returned in the same condition as received: in proper working order, with no broken or missing parts, and no unauthorized modifications or repairs.
            </p>
<p>
              HomeFix Rentals will inspect each tool at check-out and upon return. Any issues will be documented and may result in additional charges.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="liability-waiver">
<h3>7. Liability Waiver</h3>
<p>
              By renting equipment, the renter confirms they are competent and able to safely operate the tools and will follow all safety instructions, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
            </p>
<p>
              HomeFix Rentals is not responsible for any injury, loss, or damage to persons or property arising from the use or misuse of the rented equipment. The renter assumes all risks associated with operation and agrees to hold HomeFix Rentals harmless and indemnified from any related claims.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="acceptance">
<h3>8. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>
              By signing the rental agreement or completing an online booking, the renter acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to all of the above terms and conditions.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="service-plans">
<h3>9. Optional Service Plans</h3>
<p>
              HomeFix Rentals may offer optional add-on plans such as Fuel + Cleaning, Damage
              Protection, Extended Rental, Weekend Saver, Return Anytime, and Local Delivery &amp;
              Pickup. These plans are optional and will be clearly described at the time of booking.
            </p>
<p>
              Plan availability and pricing may vary by tool and rental period. Typical current
              rates are approximately: Fuel + Cleaning ($15), Damage Protection ($12), Extended
              Rental ($15), Return Anytime ($8), and Local Delivery &amp; Pickup (from $25 one-way
              or $40 round-trip), but are subject to change.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="fuel-cleaning-plan">
<h3>10. Fuel + Cleaning Plan</h3>
<p>
              If you add the Fuel + Cleaning Plan, HomeFix Rentals will refill fuel on applicable
              gas-powered tools and perform standard cleaning after the tool is returned. When this
              plan is selected, separate fuel and standard cleaning fees will not be charged unless
              the equipment is returned with excessive contamination or damage beyond normal use.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="damage-protection-plan">
<h3>11. Damage Protection Plan</h3>
<p>
              The Damage Protection Plan helps cover accidental minor damage from normal use, such
              as worn blades, small cracks, or cosmetic scuffs. It does not cover loss, theft,
              negligence, intentional damage, gross misuse, or failure to follow operating
              instructions. Coverage limits and exclusions will be explained at booking.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="time-flex-plans">
<h3>12. Extended Time &amp; Weekend Plans</h3>
<p>
              Extended Rental and Weekend Saver Plans adjust the rental period to provide additional
              hours or weekend coverage at a flat rate (typically around $15 for extended time and
              about 1.5× the daily rate for weekend coverage). If equipment is not returned by the
              agreed extended or weekend return time, standard late fees may still apply.
            </p>
</li>
<li class="terms-item" id="return-delivery-plans">
<h3>13. Return Anytime &amp; Delivery Plans</h3>
<p>
              The Return Anytime Plan may allow after-hours or alternative return arrangements using
              a designated secure drop-off location. The renter is responsible for ensuring the
              equipment is placed in the specified location and secured as instructed until it is
              retrieved.
            </p>
<p>
              Local Delivery &amp; Pickup Plans start at approximately $25 one way or $40
              round-trip within a limited service radius. The renter is responsible for being
              present (or having a designated contact present) during delivery and pickup. Risk
              transfers to the renter once equipment is delivered to the agreed location.
            </p>

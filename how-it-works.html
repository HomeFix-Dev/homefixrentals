      <section id="rental-terms" class="terms-section">
        <h2>Rental Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          By renting equipment from HomeFix Rentals, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <ul class="terms-list">
          <li class="terms-item" id="security-deposit">
            <h3>1. Security Deposit</h3>
            <p>
              A refundable security deposit may be required at the time of rental. The amount depends on the tool and is due in addition to the rental charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The deposit may be used to cover unpaid rental fees, damages, missing parts, cleaning, or fuel charges. Any remaining balance will be refunded after the equipment is returned and inspected.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="late-fees">
            <h3>2. Late Fees</h3>
            <p>
              Equipment must be returned on or before the agreed return date and time. Late returns may be charged at the full daily rate for each additional day (or portion of a day) past the due time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repeated or excessive late returns may result in additional service fees or refusal of future rentals.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="damage-charges">
            <h3>3. Damage Charges</h3>
            <p>
              The renter is responsible for any damage that occurs to the equipment during the rental period, excluding normal wear and tear.
            </p>
            <p>
              If equipment is returned broken, abused, or missing parts, the renter will be charged the cost of repair or replacement, up to the full replacement cost listed in the catalog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not attempt repairs yourself unless authorized by HomeFix Rentals.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="cleaning-fee">
            <h3>4. Cleaning Fee</h3>
            <p>
              All tools must be returned reasonably clean. Excessive dirt, mud, concrete, paint, oil, or debris may result in a cleaning fee being deducted from the deposit or added to the final invoice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concrete and mud must be rinsed off mixers, compactors, and similar tools immediately after use to avoid permanent buildup.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="fuel-policy">
            <h3>5. Fuel Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Gas-powered equipment must be returned with the same fuel level as when rented. If it is returned with less fuel, a refueling charge will apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only use the correct fuel type and mixture as indicated on the equipment or by staff. Using the wrong fuel may result in damage charges.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="same-condition">
            <h3>6. Returned in Same Condition</h3>
            <p>
              All equipment must be returned in the same condition as received: in proper working order, with no broken or missing parts, and no unauthorized modifications or repairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              HomeFix Rentals will inspect each tool at check-out and upon return. Any issues will be documented and may result in additional charges.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="liability-waiver">
            <h3>7. Liability Waiver</h3>
            <p>
              By renting equipment, the renter confirms they are competent and able to safely operate the tools and will follow all safety instructions, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
            </p>
            <p>
              HomeFix Rentals is not responsible for any injury, loss, or damage to persons or property arising from the use or misuse of the rented equipment. The renter assumes all risks associated with operation and agrees to hold HomeFix Rentals harmless and indemnified from any related claims.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="terms-item" id="acceptance">
            <h3>8. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>
              By signing the rental agreement or completing an online booking, the renter acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to all of the above terms and conditions.
